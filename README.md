I tried using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework to create a simple website for managing product inventory in a market. üõ†Ô∏è This framework is used for building web applications. Based on my experience using this framework, even though I use the VS Code code editor instead of Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, the debugging process feels slow. I'm less inclined to use this framework because of that. I'm more accustomed to using libraries like React or frameworks like Laravel. In this framework, acquiring packages also feels sluggish. For those who want to learn MVC concepts, using this framework might be helpful, but if you want to build a large-scale application, I wouldn't recommend it.
